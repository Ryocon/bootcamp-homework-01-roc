# Code-Refactoring
## Description
For this project I was tasked with refactoring code within a html and css file for a fictional marketing clients site. The refactor requirements were for all html to be semantic and for the css to be decluttered and also follow semantics. This was in order for the site to be more accessable for it's users.

In this project I added multiple tags for accessibility and reworked both the html and css to follow semantic guidelines. The following were the changes made -

## Fixed HTML - 
- Added Header tag
- Added Aside tag
- Added Footer tag
- Added Nav tag
- Added Main tag
- Added Section tags
- Added Article tags
- Added "search-engine-optimization" id to make the nav links work
- Added appropriate title
- Added alt tags and descriptions for images in article tags
- Added a title tag for hero div for accessibility
- Added alt tags in Aside imgs

## Fixed CSS -
- Fixed nav styling
- Created 'benefit-style' class to stop repeats
- Created 'main-content' class to stop repeats
- Moved 'main-contet' up to follow semantic flow of html
- Moved 'float' classes up to follow semantic flow of html
